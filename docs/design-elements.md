## Animations ✨

Our game uses fun animations to make everything feel alive:

1. **Bounce Effects**
   - Used on game cards
   - Makes clicking feel satisfying
   - Gentle and playful

2. **Fade Effects**
   - When new questions appear
   - When moving between screens
   - Makes transitions smooth

3. **Scale Effects**
   - Cards get bigger when you hover
   - Buttons shrink when clicked
   - Makes everything feel interactive

## Layout & Spacing 📏

- We use rounded corners everywhere (rounded-xl)
- Everything has nice padding (p-4 or p-6)
- Cards have subtle shadows
- Everything is centered and aligned

## Typography 📝

- Main Headings: Large, bold, and playful
- Game Text: Clear and easy to read
- Button Text: Bold and visible
- All text is responsive (changes size on different screens)

## Icons 🎯

We use Lucide icons because:
- They're simple and clear
- They look friendly
- They work well with our colors
