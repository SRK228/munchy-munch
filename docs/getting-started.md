Hey there! Let's get this fun game running on your computer. Don't worry, it's easier than it sounds! 😊

## What You Need First
1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your computer
   - Think of Node.js as the engine that runs our game
   - You can download it from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Choose the "LTS" version (it means Long Term Support - the most stable one!)

## Running the Game Locally 🎮

Follow these simple steps:

1. **Open your terminal/command prompt**
   ```bash
   # First, clone (copy) the project to your computer
   git clone [your-project-url]

   # Go into the project folder
   cd healthy-munching-game

   # Install all the game's requirements
   npm install

   # Start the game!
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your web browser**
   - Go to `http://localhost:8080`
   - You should see the game running! 🎉

## Common Problems & Solutions 🔧

If something's not working:
1. Make sure Node.js is installed properly
2. Try closing and reopening your terminal
3. If the game doesn't start, try these commands:
   ```bash
   # Remove the node_modules folder
